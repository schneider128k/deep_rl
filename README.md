# Deep reinforcement learning

I am offering a weekly seminar on deep reinforcement learning in Spring 2019.  My goal is put together materials and code for a course on deep reinforcement learning that I would teach in Fall 2019 or Spring 2020.

### Meeting on 02/08

I introduced the key concepts in RL and gave an overview of RL algorithms. I presented the mathematics behind the simplest policy gradient for categorical policies.

- [Part 2: Kinds of RL Algorithms](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html)
- [Part 3: Intro to Policy Optimization](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro3.html)

### Meeting on 02/15

I want to discuss the derivation of the improved reward-to-go policy gradient and to present its implementation in TensorFlow and Keras. I also want to apply it this algorithm to problems such as 
- [Acrobot](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/)
- [Cartpole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)
- [Lunar lander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/)

### Topics for future meeting

- Policy gradients for continuous action spaces
- [Proximal policy optimization](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/)
