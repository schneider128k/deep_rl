# Deep reinforcement learning

I am very much interested in the world models approach to reinforcement learning.

- Research paper [World models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122) by D. Ha and J. Schmidhuber
- Interactive paper [Recurrent world models facilitate policy evaluation](https://worldmodels.github.io/)
- [Reimplementation of part of the world models paper](https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/WorldModels)

The world models approach uses the following ideas:

- Variational autoencoders
- Recurrent Neural Netoworks
- Mixture Density Networks

Before diving into world models, let us review the above ideas.  The review of VAE is based on chapter 3 *Variational autoencoder* in of the book *Generative deep learning* by D. Foster. I have put the code in the folder [GDL_code](https://github.com/schneider128k/deep_rl/tree/master/GDL_code).

TO DO:

Recurrent Neural Networks

Mixture Density Networks
